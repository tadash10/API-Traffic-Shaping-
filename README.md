API Traffic Shaping Script

This is a Python script for implementing API traffic shaping using the tc and htb libraries. The script shapes incoming API traffic to mitigate the impact of DDoS attacks and other high-volume traffic events. It allows users to specify the network interface to shape traffic for, as well as the maximum rate to shape traffic to (in kbps).

The script is designed to be robust, with error handling and logging to help diagnose issues. It also provides options for verbose or quiet output, depending on the user's preferences.

This script can be useful for developers and sysadmins who need to manage high-volume API traffic and want to ensure the reliability and stability of their systems. It is available on GitHub and can be easily integrated into existing software development workflows.

Installing and Using the API Traffic Shaping Script

Here are the steps to install and use the API Traffic Shaping script through the command line in Bash:
Prerequisites

    Python 3.x installed
    tc and htb libraries installed

Installation

    Clone the GitHub repository by running the following command:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/<username>/API-Traffic-Shaping.git

Change into the directory containing the script:

bash

    cd API-Traffic-Shaping

Usage

    Run the script using the following command:

    csharp

python3 api_traffic_shaping.py -i <interface> -r <rate>

Replace <interface> with the name of the network interface to shape traffic for, and <rate> with the maximum rate to shape traffic to (in kbps).

Example:

css

    python3 api_traffic_shaping.py -i eth0 -r 1000

    This will shape traffic on the eth0 network interface to a maximum rate of 1000 kbps.

    Optional: use the -v or --verbose option to enable verbose output, or use the -q or --quiet option to suppress output.

That's it! You should now have API traffic shaping configured on the specified network interface, helping to mitigate the impact of high-volume traffic events. If you encounter any issues or errors, check the logs for more information.
